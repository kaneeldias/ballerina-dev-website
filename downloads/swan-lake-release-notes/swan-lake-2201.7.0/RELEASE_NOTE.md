## Language updates

### New features

#### Introduction of the `group by` and `collect` clauses

The language now supports the `group by` and `collect` clauses to perform aggregation-related operations. The `group by` clause is used to group a collection based on a `grouping-key`. The `grouping-key` will be unique for each group. The `collect` clause is used to group a collection into one group. 

```ballerina
import ballerina/io;
public type CovidEntry record {|
    string district;
    string province;
    decimal deaths;
|};
public final table<CovidEntry> covidTable = table [
    {district: "Colombo", province: "Western", deaths: 21},
    {district: "Kandy", province: "Central", deaths: 14},
    {district: "Kaluthara", province: "Western", deaths: 18},
    {district: "Jaffna", province: "North", deaths: 10}
];
public function main() {
    record {|string province; decimal deaths;|}[] deathsByProvince = from var {province, deaths} in covidTable
        group by province
        select {province, deaths: sum(deaths)};
    io:println(deathsByProvince);
    decimal totalDeaths = from var {deaths} in covidTable
            collect sum(deaths);
    io:println(totalDeaths);
}
```
